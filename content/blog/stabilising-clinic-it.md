Dental practices do not have time for reactive IT. The most effective strategy is to stabilise the environment first, then plan improvements in a way that protects patient flow.

## Start with visibility
Before any upgrades, map the clinical systems, vendor touchpoints, and network dependencies. A simple inventory and ownership map helps you avoid finger-pointing when issues appear.

## Prioritise stability over change
Focus on monitoring, patching, and backup verification before introducing new tools. This reduces noise and gives your team confidence that incidents will be handled consistently.

## Keep changes outside clinic hours
Planned maintenance should happen after-hours, with clear runbooks and rollback plans. This avoids disruption to reception and clinical teams.

## Document everything
Create a shared record of network diagrams, software licenses, vendor contacts, and escalation paths. Documentation reduces downtime and speeds onboarding for new staff.

If your clinic is ready for a stabilisation plan, PracticeStack can map the environment and put calm, accountable support in place.
