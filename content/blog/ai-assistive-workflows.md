AI can reduce admin load for clinics when used carefully. The key is to focus on assistive workflows and keep humans in control.

## Safe use cases
- Drafting patient communications for review
- Summarising non-clinical intake notes
- Automating routine internal reporting

## Privacy-first setup
Use approved tools, limit data exposure, and apply clear governance. Never rely on AI for medical advice or diagnosis.

## Start with a pilot
Run a small pilot with one team, capture feedback, and only scale when the workflow is stable and trusted.

PracticeStack helps clinics explore AI safely, with clear guardrails and human review.
