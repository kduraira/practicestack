Clinic websites should feel modern, fast, and trustworthy. Sometimes a refresh is enough; other times a full rebuild is the better investment.

## When a refresh works
- Your current site is structurally sound
- You need updated visuals and messaging
- Performance is acceptable but could improve

## When a rebuild is smarter
- The CMS is outdated or insecure
- Mobile experience is weak
- You need new booking or CRM integrations

## What to assess
Review performance, accessibility, and conversion data before deciding. A short discovery sprint often reveals whether a refresh will deliver enough impact.

PracticeStack designs clinic sites that load quickly, convert consistently, and integrate with booking workflows.
