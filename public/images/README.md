# Image sourcing guidance

These SVGs are **placeholders**. Replace them with licensed, high-quality stock
images before launch.

## Suggested imagery
- Calm, modern clinic receptions with natural light
- Clean workspaces and discreet technology in situ
- Teams collaborating with calm, clinical workflows
- Network infrastructure shown subtly (no close-up hardware hero shots)
- Growth dashboards and analytics in context

## What to avoid
- Cliche dental imagery (teeth close-ups, oversized smiles)
- Busy or cluttered backgrounds
- Overly saturated or gimmicky visuals

## Usage notes
- Keep aspect ratios consistent with the placeholders.
- Export optimized WebP/JPG assets for the web.
- Ensure you have appropriate commercial licensing.
