SEO for clinics is a long-term investment. The fastest wins come from getting the foundations right and aligning content to patient intent.

## Nail local signals
Claim your Google Business Profile, align your NAP details across directories, and ensure location pages include genuine service information.

## Fix technical blockers
Slow sites, broken redirects, and thin content limit visibility. Start with a technical audit and close the biggest gaps first.

## Publish with patient intent
Write content around common questions: costs, treatment options, and what to expect. Educational content builds trust and earns organic visibility.

## Measure patiently
SEO is not instant. Track progress monthly, and expect meaningful movement over 3–6 months, depending on competition.

PracticeStack combines technical SEO and clinic-focused content to build sustainable visibility.
